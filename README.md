# DSA-Learning-Journey

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Learning Journey repository! ðŸš€ Here, I document my progress as I dive into the world of DSA, sharing code solutions, problem-solving approaches, and learning resources.

## Repository Structure 
  
- **Topics:** Folder containing different DSA topics with code solutions. 
  - **Arrays:** Code for array-related problems.
  - **Linked-Lists:** Code for linked list problems. 
  - **Trees:** Code for tree-related problems.
  - **Sorting:** Code for sorting algorithms.  

- **Problem-Approaches:** Folder with general problem-solving approaches.
  - [Sliding Window](Problem-Approaches/Sliding-Window.md): Explanation of the Sliding Window approach.
  - [Divide and Conquer](Problem-Approaches/Divide-and-Conquer.md):  Explanation of the Divide and Conquer approach.   

- **Resources:** Folder with learning resources.
  - [Books](Resources/Books.md): List of recommended DSA books.
  - [Websites](Resources/Websites.md): Useful websites for DSA.
  - [Courses](Resources/Courses.md): Online courses for DSA.

- **Notes:** Folder with detailed learning notes on various DSA topics.

## How to Use

- Explore the `Topics` folder to find code solutions for specific DSA problems.
- Check the `Problem-Approaches` folder for general approaches to problem-solving.
- Utilize the `Resources` section for recommended books, websites, and courses.
- Browse the `Notes` folder for detailed learning notes on specific DSA topics.
